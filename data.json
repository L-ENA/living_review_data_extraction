#Meeting notes:
#DOne: Reference citation retrieval and conversion to RIS for expert includes
#linking reference information to the interactive prisma on the website (ish)
#In progress: Automatic website updates
#Done (but unused/bad): Parllel screening apps for dual screening (ie reference retrieval script powers 2 apps, will use this for dual expert assessments and could be used for dual initial assessments)
#some fancy interactive plots for website: The script can be adapted for suicide review

#Future problems: The dedupe script scales poorly
#make prisma automatic
